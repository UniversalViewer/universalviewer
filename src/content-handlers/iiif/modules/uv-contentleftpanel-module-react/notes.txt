this folder contains an experiment for changing the left panel into a react component using shadcn and tailwind
tailwind has been installed which requires the following config files:

tailwind.config.js
globals.css
utils.ts
components.json

only the files in this folder are target by tailwind using the following config:

module.exports = {
    ...
  content: [
    //only target experimental react components currently in iiif left panel
    "./src/content-handlers/iiif/modules/uv-contentleftpanel-module-react/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],


  components.json has 
        "css": "src/index.css",
which doesn't currently exist so that might need fixing.
