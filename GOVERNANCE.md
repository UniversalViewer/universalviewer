# UV Governance Document

Adopted 8 November 2024

Last updated 7 November 2024

Developed and drafted by members of the Universal Viewer Steering Group (alphabetically: Saira Akhter, Erin Burnand, Demian Katz, James Misson, Lanie Okorodudu), inspired by [the work of the VuFindÂ® Community Planning Group](https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind/blob/dev/GOVERNANCE.md); see [**Acknowledgements**](#acknowledgements) below for additional
attributions.

## Overview

The Universal Viewer was developed as a community driven, open source project. 
Its mission is to ensure the long-term technical and financial sustainability of the software,
its documentation, and its development processes. Anyone with an
interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the
project design, and participate in the decision-making process.

The Universal Viewer Steering Group (SG) provides a unified strategic direction and sustainability to the UV community and to allocate Open Collective funds as appropriate. Steering group membership is open to all institutions at the sponsor level on Open Collective and to other major contributors to project code and administration, subject to Steering Group approval.

This document describes how community participation takes place and how
to set about earning merit within the project.

## Roles And Responsibilities

### Users

Users are community members who have a need for the Universal Viewer. They are the
most important members of the community and without them the project
would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special
requirements.

The Universal Viewer asks its users to participate in the project and community as
much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure
that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user
contributions include (but are not limited to):

* evangelising about the project (e.g. a link on a website and word-of-mouth awareness raising)
* informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective
* starting conversations between the Universal Viewer community and
    complementary projects
* sharing manifests
* testing with different types of content
* providing practical support on all aspects of UV implementation 
* providing moral support (a 'thank you' goes a long way)
* providing financial support (the software is open source, but the
    project and community need to be sustainable)

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will
often become more and more involved. Such users may find themselves
becoming contributors, as described below.

### Organizational Users

Organizational users are commercial or non-profit entities which rely
upon the Universal Viewer for some or all of their day-to-day operations.
Organizational users might:

* sell Universal Viewer-related services (hosting, support, development)
* offer online tools powered by Universal Viewer (searchable databases,
    catalogs, etc.)
* use Universal Viewer for internal business processes (e.g. enabling search of
    an intranet)

As long as they comply with the legal terms of the software's [license](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/dev/LICENSE.txt),
organizational users have no specific obligations to the Universal Viewer
community. However, it is in their best interest to support the
sustainability of the software to ensure that it continues to meet their
needs. As such, organizational users are strongly encouraged to
contribute back to the community by sharing locally-developed code, by
encouraging and/or supporting staff to dedicate time to the project, and
by offering financial support when possible. Some forms of support also
have specific tangible benefits; see below under "Financial Membership"
for more details.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to
the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take
many forms. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no
specific skill requirements and no selection process.

In addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find
themselves doing one or more of the following:

* supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to
    support new users)
* reporting bugs
* identifying requirements
* programming (fixing bugs / adding features)
* assisting with project infrastructure
* writing and editing documentation
* offering useful services (hosting, procurement, etc.) to the
    community

Contributors engage with the project through the project's [GitHub
organization](https://github.com/UniversalViewer). They submit changes to the project itself via
[pull requests](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md),
which will be considered for inclusion in the project by existing
committers (see next section). The [Universal Viewer
Slack](https://universalviewer.slack.com)
is the most appropriate place to ask for help when making
that first contribution.

All contributions will be carefully reviewed, and detailed feedback will
be provided by the community in a timely fashion. In most cases, some
revisions will be suggested or required before a contribution can be
merged into the project. As per the project's [code of
conduct](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
feedback should always be provided in a constructive fashion, and
contributors should view this feedback as an opportunity to learn more
about the project and to develop new coding techniques; it is never
intended as a personal criticism or attack.

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their
profile within, and commitment to, the community will increase.
Contributors who demonstrate a detailed understanding of the project by
consistently submitting stable and impactful contributions may be
nominated to become committers for the project (see below).

### Committers

Committers are community members who have shown that they are committed
to the continued development of the project through ongoing engagement
with the community. Committership allows contributors to more easily
carry on with their project related activities by giving them direct
access to the project's resources. Most importantly, they have the power
not only to submit pull requests, but also to merge them into the
project.

This does not mean that committers are free to do what they want. In
fact, committers have no more authority over the project than
contributors. While committership indicates a valued member of the
community who has demonstrated a healthy respect for the project's aims
and objectives, their work should still be submitted in the form of pull
requests and must still be reviewed by the community before acceptance
in an official release. The key difference between a committer and a
contributor is that a committer can merge work that has been
successfully reviewed, while a contributor must wait for assistance from
a committer. For more details on the process, see the 
[CONTRIBUTING page](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Anyone can become a committer; there are no special requirements, other
than to have shown a willingness and ability to participate in the
project as a team player. Typically, a potential committer will need to
show that they have an understanding of the project, its objectives and
its strategy. They will also have provided valuable contributions to the
project over a period of time.

New committers can be nominated by any existing committer. Once they
have been nominated, there will be a vote by the Steering Group (SG; see below). Committer voting is one of the few activities that takes place through private SG communication. This is
to allow SG members to freely express their opinions about a nominee
without causing embarrassment.

The nominee will be directly notified by email of voting results, and is
entitled to request an explanation of any 'no' votes against them,
regardless of the outcome of the vote. This explanation will be provided
by the SG Chair (see below) and will be anonymous and
constructive in nature. New committers who pass the SG vote are announced
in the [Universal Viewer
Slack](universalviewer.slack.com).

Nominees may decline their appointment as a committer. However, this is
unusual, as the project does not expect any specific time or resource
commitment from its community members. The intention behind the role of
committer is to allow people to contribute to the project more easily,
not to tie them into the project in any formal way.

It is important to recognise that committership is a privilege, not a
right. That privilege must be earned and once earned it can be removed
by the SG (see next section) in extreme circumstances. However, under
normal circumstances committership exists for as long as the committer
wishes to continue engaging with the project.


### Universal Viewer Steering Group

The Universal Viewer Steering Group (SG) consists of those
individuals identified on the [Universal Viewer
website](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/wiki/Steering-Group). The SG has additional
responsibilities over and above those of a committer. These
responsibilities ensure the smooth running of the project. SG members
are expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic
planning, approve changes to the governance model/document, and manage
the copyrights within the project outputs. The SG also votes to fill
key roles related to Universal Viewer's membership in the Open Collective,
including a Treasurer to manage the project's finances. All special SG
roles are documented on the [Steering Group page of the Universal Viewer
website](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/wiki/Steering-Group).

Members of the SG do not have significant authority over other members
of the community, although it is the SG that votes on new committers
and responds to code of conduct violations. It also helps to make
decisions when community consensus cannot be reached. In addition, the
SG has access to the project's private communication channels. Private
communication is used for sensitive issues, such as votes for new
committers (see above), discussion of misconduct reports, and legal or
financial matters that cannot be discussed in public. It is never used
for project management or planning.

In the case of gross misconduct, such as repeated code of conduct
violations or serious breach of reviewing/merging protocol, a SG member
or committer can be removed from their role. Such a removal requires a
two-thirds majority vote of the SG. The SG may also vote on whether to
make the ban temporary or permanent, as appropriate to the
circumstances.


### Other Project Roles

While this document details some of the largest and most critical roles
and responsibilities within the Universal Viewer project, there are many smaller
jobs that support the project's success, ranging from responding to newcomer questions
to release management. Because these roles may grow and evolve over
time, it is impractical to try to capture all of them in this document;
they are instead listed on the [UV Community Team](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/dev/COMMUNITY_TEAM.md)
web page. The assignment of individuals to these roles is accomplished
by vote of the SG.

## Support

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for
new users within the project management infrastructure. This support is
provided as a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should
recognise that all support activity within the project is voluntary and
is therefore provided as and when time allows. A user requiring
guaranteed response times or results should therefore seek to purchase a
support contract from an external support provider. However, for those
willing to engage with the project on its own terms, and willing to help
support other users, the community support channels on [Slack](universalviewer.slack.com) are ideal.

## Financial Membership

Financial membership enables the project to be financially sustainable
and, in time, financially independent. Financial membership is available
at various levels, with certain benefits applying to each level.
Membership levels and benefits are set by the SG, and current options
are summarized on the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/universalviewer)
web page. Lack of financial membership does not preclude any member of
the community from contributing in any
other way to the project. Financial
support is essential and greatly appreciated, but it is not a substitute
for meaningful engagement with the work of the project.

## Decision Making Process

Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion
with all members of the community, from the newest user to the most
experienced SG member. All non-sensitive project management discussion
takes place on the [Universal Viewer
Slack](universalviewer.slack.com). Occasionally, sensitive discussion occurs in private, as
discussed above under [**Universal Viewer Steering Group**](#universal-viewer-steering-group).

In order to ensure that the project is not bogged down by endless
discussion and continual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy
consensus. This allows the majority of decisions to be made without
resorting to a formal vote.

### Lazy consensus

Decision making typically involves the following steps:

* Proposal
* Discussion
* Vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion)
* Decision

Any community member can make a proposal for consideration by the
community. In order to initiate a discussion about a new idea, they
should submit a [pull
request](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/pulls) or [issue](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/issues). For complex
or potentially controversial submissions, sending a message to the
[Universal Viewer
Slack](https://universalviewer.slack.com)
is also strongly encouraged, to ensure that the submissions
receive an appropriate amount of attention. This will prompt a review
and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this review and
discussion is to gain approval for the contribution. Since most people
in the project community have a shared vision, there is often little
need for discussion in order to reach consensus.

In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it
is recognised as having the support of the community. This is called
lazy consensus - that is, those who have not stated their opinion
explicitly have implicitly agreed to the implementation of the proposal.

Lazy consensus is a very important concept within the project. It is
this process that allows a large group of people to efficiently reach
consensus, as someone with no objections to a proposal need not spend
time stating their position, and others need not spend time reading such
messages.

For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72
hours before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This
requirement ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest
and respond to the proposal. This time period is chosen so as to be as
inclusive as possible of all participants, regardless of their location
and time commitments.

In cases where lazy consensus cannot be reached, discussion should take
place within the comments of the issue ticket or pull request
representing the proposal, in order to keep the conversation associated
with the submission. If a real-time discussion is desirable, a request
can be sent to the [Universal Viewer
Slack](https://universalviewer.slack.com)
list to have the item added to the agenda for the next scheduled
[Community Call](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/wiki/Community-Call). If 72
hours pass with no dissenting comments left unresolved in the
conversation, and with no pending Community Call discussion scheduled,
consensus can be considered to have been reached. Otherwise, voting may
be necessary to reach a final decision.

### Voting

Not all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. Technical
conversations that cannot be fully resolved through conversation may
need a vote for resolution, and issues such as those affecting the
strategic direction or legal standing of the project must gain explicit
approval in the form of a vote. Every member of the community is
encouraged to express their opinions in all discussion and all votes.
However, only a subset of the community have binding votes for the
purposes of decision making. The voting mechanism and participants vary
depending on the type of vote.

#### Technical Votes

Technical votes are required when consensus cannot be reached around a
proposal or submission. The question being voted on should be phrased
clearly and unambiguously, such as "Should we merge pull request X?" or
"Should we make architectural change / technical decision Y?" Voting
should be announced through a message on the [Universal Viewer
Slack](https://universalviewer.slack.com).
Feedback is welcomed from the entire community, but only committers have
binding votes. Votes are made through public comment on the issue or PR
under discussion. If, after one week from the start of voting, a simple
majority has been reached among eligible voters, the issue is considered
resolved. In the case of a tie, a simple majority among SG members can
serve as a tie-breaker. In the case of a further tie, the SG Chair can make the final decision.

#### Steering Group Votes

As noted above, there are a number of circumstances that may require a
vote of the SG: resolving code of conduct
issues, adjusting policies, and making high-level decisions about legal
and financial matters. Any member of the SG may raise such an issue for
voting via the group's private communication channel, and group members
will have one week to respond. At the end of the voting period, a
two-thirds majority must be reached to take the proposed action or make
the proposed change. The voting period may be resolved early if all SG
members have participated.

Because SG voting takes place in private, it is important for project
transparency that voting outcomes are shared with the larger community.
Votes involving interpersonal conflict resolution \-- for example, code
of conduct violations \-- will not be shared to protect the privacy of
the parties involved. All other decisions should be shared to the
[Universal Viewer
Slack](https://universalviewer.slack.com)
by a SG member. 


#### Communication and Monitoring

Committers and members of the SG are strongly encouraged to follow the
project's GitHub organization so that they will receive notifications of
new pull requests and can contribute reviews as their time and expertise
permit. Contributors are also encouraged to send a message about their
contribution to the [Universal Viewer
Slack](https://universalviewer.slack.com)
if they do not receive a review in a timely fashion.
