# UV Community Team

The Universal Viewer [Governance Document](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/dev/GOVERNANCE.md) explains how the project's open source community operates.

The [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) explains some of the more technical aspects of participating in the project.

All community members are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This page expands upon some specific roles that members of the community may wish to take on.

## Primary Role Descriptions

### Active Community Team Members

Active Community Members are visibly active in our Slack and/or GitHub channels. We identify active members as being those whom contributors and staff can most count on for a response within 2-3 days.

These individuals are willing and able to help with some or all of the following tasks:

- Responding to newcomer questions in [Slack](http://universalviewer.io/#contact) and on GitHub.
- Helping select tasks for newcomers or other community members who are unsure of where to start.
- Reviewing pull requests.
- Where possible, helping bring a PR to a final acceptable state, based on engineering review.
- Providing useful feedback in issues.

### Translation Team

The Universal Viewer's interface has been translated into several languages. If you have language skills and would like to assist in adding support for a new language or helping to maintain an existing one, please join the #translations channel in the project's Slack.

## Joining the Team

We welcome active contributors to join the UV team. Specifically, we are looking for contributors with:

- Passion for IIIF, TypeScript, React
- Interest in helping other contributors, and fostering community growth
- Two months of active contribution to the repository.

To apply, simply contact one of our staff or community team members via Slack or email, and we'll get right back to you.

### Review Periods

Once per year, we'll check in with our team members (both _active_ and _on break_) to ensure they are feeling supported, and to check if they will remain active on our team for the coming months. If we do not hear back from members at check-in time, they will be transitioned to an alumni role. Alumni will be acknowledged here as thanks for their past service and are still welcome to participate in the community, but they are no longer expected to respond quickly to inquiries or meet other specific standards of community service. Alumni can have their names entirely removed from the list by request.
