We welcome active contributors to join the UV team. Specifically, we are looking for contributors with:

* Passion for IIIF, TypeScript, stenciljs
* Interest in helping other contributors, and fostering community growth
* Two months of active contribution to the repository.

To apply, simply contact one of our staff or community team members via Slack or email, and we'll get right back to you.

We embrace diversity, and invite people from any and all backgrounds to get involved in the UV project.

### Review Periods

Once per year, we'll check in with our team members (both _active_ and _on break_) to ensure they are feeling supported, and to check if they will remain active on our team for the coming months. If we do not hear back from members at check-in time, they will be transitioned to an alumni role.
